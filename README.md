# portfolio-advanced-css-challenge

## Description
This is an example portfolio site for me. I set it up with guidelines in mind, those being a functional navigation bar, various links to my work, various viewport layouts, and links describing ways in which to contact me. There is not a lot of content to display, but in the meantime there have been placeholders put in place that are meant to be removed at a later time.
